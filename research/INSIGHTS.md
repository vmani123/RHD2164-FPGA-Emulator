# INSIGHTS — distilled, theory-rooted learnings for codec selection

**Read this before every Survey.** This is the *principle-level* knowledge base: what
the harness has **proven on REAL data** about which compression mechanisms work here and
**why**, stated in terms of sound compression theory so it actively guides which
candidate to try next. It complements — does not duplicate — the other records:

- `CYCLE_LOG.md` — one raw row per cycle (append-only ledger of *what* was tried).
- `experiments/NNN_*.md` — the full per-experiment record (commands, outputs, verdicts).
- `SURVEY.md` — forward-looking *proposals* (unverified).
- **`INSIGHTS.md` (this file)** — the backward-looking *distilled truth*: the durable
  lessons, each tied to evidence and to a compression-theory reason, plus the ranked
  open frontier and the dead ends not to re-propose.

**Maintenance (every cycle, by the analyst):** after measurement + verification, append
or refine the relevant principle below with the new evidence. A learning enters this file
only when the harness measured it on **real** data (synthetic is mechanism-illustration
only). State the *theory* for why the result holds, not just the number — a number without
a mechanism does not generalize to the next candidate.

**Latitude (explicit):** candidates need not come from a paper. You may **design a novel
codec** by combining or extending the existing primitives (predictive coding, reversible
integer transforms/lifting, context modeling, Golomb/Rice, ANS) **provided the design is
rooted in sound compression theory** — i.e. you can state *why* it should lower the
residual's entropy or decorrelate the array better, from an information-theoretic or
signal-model argument, before measuring. Novelty is welcome; unprincipled "try X and see"
is not. Every novel design faces the same bars: lossless + bit-exact, `embedded_ok`, and
**real data decides**.

## Established principles (proven on real HD-sEMG)

### P1 — Cross-channel spatial decorrelation is the dominant lever, and it is bounded by the array's real neighbour correlation.
- **Evidence:** achieved cross-channel gain +10.8% (Hyser) to +17.4% (OTB) to +13.1%
  (CEMHSEY); **near-zero (+1.3%) on CapgMyo**, whose differential 8×16 array has neighbour
  |corr| ≈ 0.29. Ablation: turning `+xchan` on vs off is worth ~70× every temporal knob.
- **Theory:** a per-channel coder cannot remove redundancy that lives *between* channels
  (shared spatial/common-mode content). The reducible bits ≈ the mutual information between
  a channel and its neighbours, which grows with their correlation. Where neighbour
  correlation is low, that mutual information — and thus the achievable gain — is small
  *by the physics*, not by codec weakness.
- **Implication:** prioritize spatial mechanisms **only where real neighbour correlation is
  high**. On low-correlation arrays the ceiling is real; do not chase spatial gain there.
  CapgMyo is the honest negative control that confirms the harness reports gain only where
  the signal carries it.

### P2 — Temporal prediction saturates early; deeper prediction *hurts* on real data.
- **Evidence:** order-4 LMS beats order-8 on both Hyser and OTB (order 4→8 *costs* ratio in
  the ablation); the registry default was over-provisioned at order-8.
- **Theory:** after a low-order linear predictor the HD-sEMG residual is already close to
  white — the remaining structure the extra taps could exploit is mostly noise, so a longer
  adaptive filter fits noise (raising, not lowering, coded entropy) while its state and
  per-sample cost grow with order.
- **Implication:** keep the temporal predictor **small** (order ≤4). Spend complexity on the
  spatial front-end and the entropy back-end, not on deeper temporal prediction.

### P3 — For the spatial transform, *data-dependent* beats *data-independent*.
- **Evidence:** the fixed 45° integer-KLT front-end (`LMS+Rice+iklt`, cycle 2026-07-13)
  captured only ~+8.8% real cross-channel gain — about **half** the adaptive single-neighbour
  subtract's +18.0% — and was Pareto-dominated (worse ratio, higher cost). Retired.
- **Theory:** the KLT is the optimal linear decorrelator **only when its basis matches the
  true covariance**. A fixed 45° rotation is exactly the KLT for a *stationary, isotropic,
  equal-variance* neighbour pair. Real HD-sEMG covariance is **anisotropic and
  non-stationary**, so a fixed basis is mismatched and leaves cross-channel redundancy
  uncaptured; the adaptive per-neighbour weight (`beta`) tracks the actual, drifting pairwise
  correlation and removes more of it.
- **Implication:** adaptive/data-dependent decorrelation > fixed transforms on this data. A
  multi-tap spatial transform is only worth its cost if its **basis adapts** (data-dependent
  lifting), which is borderline on the embedded budget — a fixed multi-tap basis will not beat
  the adaptive rank-1 subtract here.

### P4 — Embeddability is a hard gate; rank on the ratio-vs-cost Pareto front, and prefer backward-adaptive (zero side-info).
- **Evidence:** `LMS+Rice+xchan_adaptive` (backward-adaptive integer beta) was kept for
  closing the port caveat even though marginally dominated; the incumbent's headline beta is a
  float whole-signal value computed offline — **not producible on-node**. Best-partner adds
  side-info (partner id + beta) for only +0.4% real ratio at +10% cost — a genuine but marginal
  non-dominated corner.
- **Theory:** anything the decoder can recompute from already-reconstructed causal history costs
  **zero side-info** and is streaming-legal; anything derived from the whole recording (offline)
  or shipped in the header trades bits and on-node feasibility for ratio.
- **Implication:** prefer backward-adaptive parameter estimation (decoder mirrors encoder from
  reconstructed data). Treat any offline/whole-signal parameter as a **port caveat**, not a real
  on-node result. Never rank on ratio alone — a higher-cost point must *earn* its place on the
  Pareto front.

### P5 — Rice/Golomb is near-optimal for the (near-geometric) residual; the entropy back-end is a small, still-unproven lever.
- **Evidence:** every embeddable codec here uses adaptive Golomb-Rice and lands close to the
  offline generic references (lzma/zstd) it should not be able to reach with a per-symbol coder.
- **Theory:** Golomb-Rice is the optimal prefix code for an exactly-geometric (Laplacian-ish)
  residual. Real residual blocks deviate from geometric, so a table-driven ANS coder *could*
  recover the sub-Golomb fraction — but the per-block frequency table (side-info) and reverse
  encode buffer may cost more than the bits gained.
- **Implication:** an rANS/tANS back-end is worth a **head-to-head vs Rice on the same
  predictor**, but expect a small, uncertain payoff — it is a refinement, not the main lever.

## Open frontier (untried levers, ranked by expected payoff/cost)

1. **Entropy back-end swap — rANS/tANS vs Rice on the same predictor** (P5). The one axis never
   tested; FPGA-friendly as tANS (table lookups + renorm, no per-symbol division).
2. **Data-*dependent* multi-tap spatial transform** (P3). A lifting transform whose basis adapts
   backward per block — the only way a multi-tap front-end could beat the adaptive rank-1 subtract
   without violating P3. Watch the cost gate (per-block basis estimation).
3. **Best-partner selection rebuilt on the order-4 predictor** (P2 + P4). Cycle 2's best-partner
   used order-8; on the search-proven cheaper order-4 it might dominate the incumbent on *both*
   axes instead of only extending the ratio ceiling at extra cost.

## Dead ends (retired — do NOT re-propose as new; a genuinely different variant must say why)

- **Fixed data-independent inter-channel transform** (`LMS+Rice+iklt`): fixed 45° integer-KLT,
  dominated — its isotropy/stationarity assumption is violated by real HD-sEMG (P3).
- **Per-block single-neighbour adaptive beta alone** (`LMS+Rice+xchan_adaptive`): dominated by the
  incumbent on real OTB (worse ratio AND higher cost); kept only for the zero-side-info port story.

## Sanity anchors

- Real embeddable ratios on HD-sEMG live in **~1.3–2.2×**. Any lossless ratio **> ~6×** on
  realistic broadband ⇒ a leak or degenerate data — stop and report.
- **Success is not beating Shannon.** Independent per-channel noise caps lossless at ~3–3.5×.
  Success = beat per-channel FLAC / the embeddable references on real grids at a fraction of the
  compute, proven bit-exact — and, as a stretch, close the gap to offline lzma.
